<p>Welcome to Sa Meron Manok! Ensuring a delightful gaming experience and respecting your privacy are our top priorities. This comprehensive Privacy Policy provides insights into how we handle your information. By downloading, installing, or playing our casual game, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>1. Information We Collect</p>

<p>1.1. Personal Information: We don’t collect personal information unless you willingly share it, such as when contacting support, subscribing to newsletters, or creating an account. Personal info might include your name, email, or other details you provide.</p>

<p>1.2. Non-Personal Information: We automatically gather non-personal information like device type, operating system, device model, IP addresses, and in-game interactions. This helps us understand user behavior, improve game features, and enhance the overall gaming experience.</p>

<p>2. How We Use Your Information</p>

<p>2.1. Personal Information: If you share personal information, it is solely used for the intended purpose—support, newsletters, or personalized gaming experiences. We don’t share personal information with third parties, and you can opt out of promotional materials.</p>

<p>2.2. Non-Personal Information: Non-personal information is used for analytics, game improvement, and tailoring the gaming experience. It’s aggregated and anonymized to identify trends, enhance gameplay, and provide personalized content.</p>

<p>3. Disclosure of Your Information</p>

<p>We do not sell, trade, or share personal information. Non-personal information may be shared with trusted third parties, like analytics providers or advertisers, to assist in improving the game or for relevant advertisements. These third parties are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>

<p>4. Advertising and Third-Party Services</p>

<p>4.1. Advertising: The game may feature third-party ads, and advertisers may collect non-personal information for targeted ads. Check the advertisers' privacy policies for more details.</p>

<p>4.2. Third-Party Services: Integrations with third-party services (e.g., social media) are subject to their privacy policies. Review them before using integrated services.</p>

<p>5. Data Security</p>

<p>We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your information. These include encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments. While we strive for data security, no method is foolproof, and we can’t guarantee absolute security. In the event of a data breach, we will promptly notify affected users as required by law.</p>

<p>6. Children's Privacy</p>

<p>Our game is not designed for users under 13, and we don’t knowingly collect personal information from them. If you think we’ve collected information from a child under 13, please contact us, and we'll promptly address it.</p>

<p>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in practices or for operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Significant changes will be communicated through updates within the game or on our website. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.</p>
